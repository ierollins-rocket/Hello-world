We chose the name Rocket Propulsion Labs because starting a company is a lot like a space launch. Both require the ability to overcome improbable odds. For a space launch, it’s defying the law of gravity to soar beyond the atmosphere. For entrepreneurs, it’s beating the startup physics that challenges scaling and hypergrowth.

What are needed for both are the right vehicle, the right team, ample support, and most importantly - fuel.

In a nutshell, we sell rocket fuel. Not literal fuel, but seed capital and support to help high potential startups (rockets) defy physics and reach unimaginable heights.
